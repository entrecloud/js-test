## Getting Started

If you have yarn installed you can copy-paste the code below, otherwise replace with corresponding npm commands.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/entrecloud/js-test.git
cd js-test
yarn # npm i
yarn test # npm test
```

The tests will run with `mocha --watch` and should immediately fail.

Your task is to correct any errors and make the 3 tests pass.

All the instruction are in the `index.js` file.

## Submitting the code

Once you've completed the code and passed the tests, you have a few options:
- Send us the `index.js` file as an attachment in your application
- Send us a link to a Gist on GitHub with the contents of your `index` file
- **Do not make a pull request to origin**
- - ** I saw and understand this **

Once we've received your submission, we will send you our own solution to the task for you to review.

If you are selected, we will contact you for a brief interview. You will likely begin with your first assignment right there and then.
